# SciSketch

## Introduction

The field of life sciences continues to generate an overwhelming amount of research and published literature. With the rapid growth of scientific knowledge, it has become increasingly challenging for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to quickly grasp the key findings and significance of research papers. Graphical abstracts have emerged as a valuable tool to summarize complex scientific concepts visually. However, creating these abstracts manually is time-consuming and requires specialized design skills. This proposal seeks to address this challenge by organizing a Generative AI Hackathon to develop an AI-powered Graphical Abstract Generator for life science published papers and literature.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is the inefficiency and expertise required in creating graphical abstracts for life science papers. This manual process often hinders the accessibility and comprehension of scientific research. Researchers spend valuable time designing these abstracts, leaving less time for actual research. Moreover, individuals without design skills find it difficult to create informative graphical abstracts.


## Solution

We propose the development of an AI-powered Graphical Abstract Generator—named **SciSketch** — that can automatically analyze the content of life science papers and generate informative and visually appealing graphical abstracts. This tool will significantly reduce the time and effort required to create graphical abstracts and enhance the accessibility and understanding of scientific literature.

## Goals and Objectives

1.	Frontend: Develop web-app based friendly user-interface for SciSketch
2.	Backend: Integrate ChatGPT API for entity idnetification and relationship extraction
